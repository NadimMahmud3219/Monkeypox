# Monkeypox
# Monkeypox Detection Using Deep Learning and Explainable AI
# Project Overview

This project focuses on automated Monkeypox detection from medical skin lesion images using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. Multiple pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures were implemented and compared to evaluate classification performance.

In addition to predictive modeling, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied to improve model interpretability and support medical decision-making.
